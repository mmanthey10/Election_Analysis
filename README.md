## Audit Summary

This script can be used for future election audits. In order to adapt the script to future elections, I would recommend the following solutions:
* Include previous election data to track the voter turnout over time. 
* Additionally, future audits could include voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voter to understand voter population participation rate.
* Lastly, depending on state requirements, code could be added to add a logic statement to determine if a recount is required based on how close candidates are in vote totals.
